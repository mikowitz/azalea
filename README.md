# Azalea

A rose tree is a tree in which each node has an unbounded number of children, each of which is itself a rose tree.

The name `azalea` was picked because rhododendrons (whence the name of this data structure) and azaleas belong to the same genus,
and I wanted to not be another `rose_tree` repo on Github.

Also, I love the Duke Ellington song, especially these two versions:

* [Ellington + Louis Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLt18wjcfkI)
* [covered by Paul Curreri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtjeKBMFQxo)
